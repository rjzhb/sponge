//! \brief An in-order byte stream.

//! Bytes are written on the "input" side and read from the "output"
//! side.  The byte stream is finite: the writer can end the input,
//! and then no more bytes can be written.

    // that's a sign that you probably want to keep exploring
    // different approaches.
